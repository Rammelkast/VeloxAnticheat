# About
The goal of Velox is to create a simple and accurate anticheat, based on only the tools made available by Bukkit/Spigot. 
This means no external libraries, no reflection and no NMS. Why? Because why not (there are many reasons why).

**As of now (30/12/2021) this plugin is not release-ready and you should not be using it in a production environment.**
